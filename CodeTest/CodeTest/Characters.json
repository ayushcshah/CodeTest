He became a <a href=\"/ninja/3015-12/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-12\">ninja</a> to provide a better life for his wife and son against the wishes of his father, himself already a member of the Shirai. His clan's most hated rivals were the <a href=\"/lin-kuei/3015-5062/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5062\">Lin Kuei</a> clan. Scorpion and his mortal enemy <a href=\"/noob-saibot/3005-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-152\">Sub-Zero</a> were both hired by Quan Chi to retrieve a scroll from the <a href=\"/himalayas/3035-3474/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3474\">Himalayas</a>, but the two ninjas crossed paths, leading them to fight in the mountains. Sub-Zero emerged the winner, decapitating Scorpion with his ice blade in the process. This scenario played out in <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-mythologies-sub-zero/3030-17295/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17295\"><i>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</i></a> in which Scorpion played a <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">boss</a>. Scorpion soon found himself in the Netherrealm, where he again fought and lost to Sub-Zero later in the same game, presented with a choice: an eternity in hell, or a return to Earth as a spectre with no memories of his past. Scorpion chose revenge, and returned to Earth only to find that Sub-Zero had wiped out the Shirai Ryu clan entirely, including his wife and child.</p><p>He enrolled in the first <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\">Mortal Kombat</a> tournament as an undead warrior to seek out and kill Sub-Zero at long last. He succeeded in this, but lost the overall tournament. His victory was short-lived when he heard that Sub-Zero had entered the second <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3571\">Mortal Kombat</a> tournament and Scorpion followed suit. The wraith tracked down his nemesis but, after seeing him spare the life of an opponent, realized he couldn't be the man who killed him. It was revealed to him that this was actually Sub-Zero's younger brother, taking on his dead brother's identity to restore honour to the title of Sub-Zero in murdering so many unjustly as well as failing to kill <a href=\"/shang-tsung/3005-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-92\">Shang Tsung</a>, the first tournament's host. Scorpion unexpectedly vowed to protect the new Sub-Zero, after recognizing a kinship as he had also abandoned the evil ways of his past.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-358644\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 466px\" data-ratio=\"1.068669527897\" data-width=\"466\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:106.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-358644\"><img alt=\"Scorpion in Deadly Alliance\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3699/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/3699/358644-scorpionkjpg.jpg 466w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px\" data-width=\"598\"></a><figcaption>Scorpion in Deadly Alliance</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href=\"/ultimate-mortal-kombat-3/3030-2178/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2178\">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a>, <a href=\"/netherrealm/3035-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-615\">Netherrealm</a> was invaded by <a href=\"/shao-kahn/3005-91/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-91\">Shao Kahn,</a> who attacked Earth and recruited Scorpion into his army. The alliance, which COULD be described as deadly, was quickly dissolved when Scorpion learned of young Sub-Zero being on the side of Earth Realm. Scorpion immediately joined Earth's warriors to defeat Shao Kahn's forces but this alliance, too, was short-lived as in <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-4/3030-6421/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6421\">Mortal Kombat 4</a>, Scorpion was tricked into believing that Sub-Zero HAD killed his family by evil sorcerer Quan Chi. Scorpion confronted and defeated Sub-Zero, who denied involvement in his family's death. Quan Chi revealed himself the true killer and cast a spell to return Scorpion to the Netherrealm. Scorpion hurled himself at Quan Chi before the spell fully took affect and transported Quan Chi to the hellish dimension with him.</p><p><a href=\"/mortal-kombat-deadly-alliance/3030-6588/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6588\">Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</a> found Quan Chi rescued from Netherrealm by the demons <a href=\"/moloch/3005-398/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-398\">Moloch</a> and <a href=\"/drahmin/3005-382/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-382\">Drahmin</a>, who then attacked Scorpion. Scorpion tracked Quan Chi while evading the two demons. He was unable to find the sorcerer, but was found by the Elder Gods who enlisted him to defeat <a href=\"/onaga/3005-401/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-401\">Onaga</a> before he could destroy the realms. Scorpion failed, taking the storyline to the events of <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-deception/3030-383/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-383\">Mortal Kombat: Deception</a>, in which the realms were unmade. In <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-armageddon/3030-11843/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11843\">Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</a>, Scorpion entreated the Elder Gods to resurrect his clan, including his family, in exchange for serving them as an agent. Before they reunited, however, Quan Chi appeared again and dragged Scorpion's son to Netherrealm. The newly crowned leader of the revived Shirai clan vowed to not rest until he finds, and kills, Quan Chi.</p><h2>Endings</h2><p>Scorpion rarely has a grudge against any of the \"boss\" characters of <i>Mortal Kombat</i>, and as such many of his endings are actually canonical as they don't require him to win the entire <a href=\"/tournament/3015-1096/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1096\">tournament</a>.</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat</b></h3><p>Scorpion avenges the murder of his family by killing Sub-Zero, but the victory is bittersweet for even as champion of Mortal Kombat, he can never again see them in this life.</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat II</b></h3><p>Scorpion realizes the man he tracked to the second Mortal Kombat tournament, Sub-Zero, isn't his murderer. After winning the tournament, he vows to become the guardian of this new <a href=\"/sub-zero/3005-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2\">Sub-Zero</a> to atone for his sins and to prepare for the inevitable third Mortal Kombat.</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat 3</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346271\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 500px\" data-ratio=\"2.2\" data-width=\"500\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:220.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-346271\"><img alt=\"Scorpion in Armageddon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg 500w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg 436w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg 290w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Scorpion in Armageddon\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg 500w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg 436w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5128/346271-mkd_scorpion.jpg 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" data-width=\"290\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Scorpion in Armageddon</figcaption></figure><p>Scorpion turns on Shao Kahn after learning of Sub-Zero's presence in the Earth's guardians. He kills Shao Kahn and returns Earth to normal, but he is once again damned to return to <a href=\"/netherrealm/3035-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-615\">Netherrealm</a> to wait to rise again.</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat 4</b></h3><p>Scorpion stands ready to kill Sub-Zero again for the death of his family, but Sub-Zero denies the crime. Quan Chi reveals himself as the killer and casts a spell to send Scorpion back to the Netherrealm. Scorpion hurls himself forward, tackling Quan Chi and transporting him back to hell as well.</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</b></h3><p>Scorpion tracks Quan Chi to Shang Tsung's palace where he's confronted by Moloch and Drahmin. It seems Shang Tsung had aligned himself with the two demons in secret and kept them as a secondary defense against Quan Chi. The two demons overpower Scorpion, but are unable to consume him. Instead, they bring him to the portal to the Heavens and cast him into the Soulnado, having the souls there tear Scorpion's spectral body to shreds. Congratulations!</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat: Deception</b></h3><p>Scorpion, the chosen warrior of the gods (not <a href=\"/shujinko/3005-406/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-406\">Shujinko</a>, who was deceived into believing that it was him), tracks Onaga the Dragon King to the Nexus and uses his newfound Elder God-infused powers to kill Onaga once and for all.</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat: Armageddon</b></h3><p>Scorpion's defeat of <a href=\"/blaze/3005-373/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-373\">Blaze</a> resurrects his massive Shirai Ryu clan and they kneel, ready to their master's bidding. Among them are Scorpion's wife and son, but the reunion is cut when Quan Chi appears and abducts Scorpion's son through a portal to Netherrealm. Scorpion commands his new army to go after them, vowing to not rest until Quan Chi is dead and his son is safe.</p><h3><strong>Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe</strong></h3><p>After the battle against Dark Kahn, his consciousness survived and made it into Scorpion's body. With this, he can become a more powerful being, if he survives the transformation.</p><h3><b>Mortal Kombat (2011)</b></h3><p>Scorpion defeats Shao Kahn, but finds no rest for the torment brought by the slaughter of his clan. He returns to the destroyed village of the Shirai Ryu, and there he is greeted with apparitions of his fallen comrades. They reveal to him the orchestrator of the attack that wiped them out, Quan Chi, and with their help, Scorpion returns to the Netherrealm and carries out his revenge.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Mortal Kombat X</h3><p>Remorse for the release of Shinnok weighs on Scorpion. When Hanzo Hasashi prepares to kill himself to make amends for his crime, Raiden instead sentences the ninja spectre to life. With the Jinsei imbued into Scorpion, he and his Shirai Ryu will defend Earthrealm for all eternity.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>Scorpion's trademark phrases: \"<i>Get Over Here!</i>\" and \"<i>Come Here!</i>\" have always been voiced by <a href=\"/ed-boon/3040-11102/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-11102\">Ed Boon</a>, even in the live-action movies. This makes Ed Boon the world record holder for a single actor playing a videogame character the longest, as the original <i>Mortal Kombat</i> came out twenty years ago.

Bi Han was the first <a href=\"/noob-saibot/3005-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-152\">Sub-Zero</a>. He was merciless, and also the killer of <a href=\"/scorpion/3005-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1\">Scorpion</a>. He was a participant of the original <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\">Mortal Kombat</a> tournament, however, during that tournament, the undead Scorpion had his revenge, ending Bi Han's life. This deceased Sub-Zero was banished to the <a href=\"/netherrealm/3035-615/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-615\">Netherrealm</a> and became the undead fighter <a href=\"/noob-saibot/3005-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-152\">Noob Saibot</a>. His younger brother, Kuai Liang, partook in the <a href=\"/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3571\">second MK Tournament</a> in order to complete the mission of his fallen brother. He is known as a kinder, balanced warrior who fought out of a sense of justice, not cruelty and anger. When Scorpion witnessed him spare a combatant's life, he realized this was not the Sub-Zero he loathed. Since then, the younger Sub-Zero has become older, stronger and wiser; growing out of the shadow of his brother's legacy and transforming into a powerful leader in his own right.</p><h3>Profile (as of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon)</h3><ul><li><b>Alignment:</b> Good (Formerly Evil)</li><li><b>Species:</b> Cryomancer</li><li><b>Origin:</b> Earthrealm</li><li><b>Allies:</b> <a href=\"/liu-kang/3005-188/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-188\">Liu Kang</a>, <a href=\"/raiden/3005-125/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-125\">Raiden</a>, <a href=\"/sareena/3005-404/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-404\">Sareena</a></li><li><b>Enemies:</b> <a href=\"/scorpion/3005-1/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-1\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/noob-saibot/3005-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-152\">Noob Saibot</a>, <a href=\"/quan-chi/3005-402/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-402\">Quan Chi</a>, <a href=\"/frost/3005-380/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-380\">Frost</a></li></ul><h2>Appearances</h2><h3>Mortal Kombat II</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3571\"><i>Main Article</i></a></li></ul><p>Kuai Liang was sent to the Mortal Kombat tournament after his brother, <a href=\"/noob-saibot/3005-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-152\">Bi-Han</a>, the original Sub-Zero failed to kill <a href=\"/shang-tsung/3005-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-92\">Shang Tsung</a> and return home.

In Shaolin Monks, he freezes his foe before doing so. Used first by his sibling in Mortal Kombat, Sub-Zero carries on the tradition in later games.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Deep Freeze - (MKII, MK4, MKG, MK:SM):</b> Sub-Zero freezes his opponent before walking forward and delivering an uppercut, which either shatters the opponent's torso, shatters them entirely, or rips them in half, depending on the game. Mortal Kombat II required two sets of inputs to complete the full Fatality, one to freeze, and one to uppercut.</li><li><b>Ice Grenade - (MKII):</b> Standing far from his foe, Sub-Zero conjures a small ball of ice in his hand. He tosses it toward his enemy, causing their entire upper half to explode violently.</li><li><b>Ice Breath - (MK3, UMK3, MKT):</b> Sub-Zero breaths on his opponent, freezing them solid. They fall backward, shattering upon the ground.</li><li><b>Snap Freeze - (MK3, UMK3, MKT, MKvsDCU):</b> Lifting his enemy over his head and freezing them, Sub-Zero proceeds to snap his opponent in half. This was modified in Mortal Kombat vs.DC Universe, where the opponent is thrown to the ground and shattered.</li><li><b>Skeleton Rip - (MK:DA):</b> Very similar to <a href=\"/kano/3005-216/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-216\">Kano</a>'s MK3 Fatality. Sub-Zero inserts his hand into the loser's lower back and rips out their entire skeletal structure.</li><li><b>Frozen Throw - (MK:D):</b> Sub-Zero freezes his opponent before tearing their head off. Sliding backward, he then throws the head back at his foe, shattering their still frozen body.</li><li><b>Leg Shatter - (MK:D):</b> Sub-Zero freezes the loser's legs and shatters them with a sweep. As the legless opponent tries futilely to escape, he walks up and smashes their head with his foot.</li><li><b>Frozen Kick - (MKvsDCU):</b> After freezing them thoroughly, Sub-Zero delivers a kick to the midsection that breaks them into pieces.</li><li><b>Frozen Torso Rip - (MK:2011):</b> Freezing the lower half of his foe's body, Sub-Zero yanks their torso a few times before separating the two halves.</li><li><b>Spine Shatter - (MK:2011):</b> Sub-Zero reaches into his opponent's chest, pulling out their spine. He then freezes his foe before smashing them with their own spine.</li></ul><h4>Finishers</h4><ul><li><b>Friendship - (MKII):</b> Sub-Zero whips out a doll-sized version of himself, exhorting the player to \"Buy a Sub-Zero Doll!\"</li><li><b>Friendship - (MK3, UMK3, MKT):</b> Using his substantial mastery of cold, Sub-Zero transforms himself into a festive snowman.</li><li><b>Animality - (MK3, UMK3, MKT):</b> Morphing into a polar bear, Sub-Zero leaps onto the losing player and savagely attacks them.</li><li><b>Hara-Kiri - (MK:D):</b> Sub-Zero freezes himself from the feet up, falling over and breaking apart into a pile of ice, blood, and body parts.</li></ul><h2>Transformations/Enhancements</h2><h3>Cyber Sub-Zero</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1745834\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"840\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1745834\"><img alt=\"Cyber Sub-Zero\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg 840w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg 720w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Cyber Sub-Zero\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg 840w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg 720w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2487/1745834-cyber_ninja_sub_zero_mk_2011_vs_pose.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Cyber Sub-Zero</figcaption></figure><p>In the alternate timeline of <a href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25042\">Mortal Kombat 2011</a>, Raiden attempts to save Smoke from being transformed into a Cyborg Ninja, only for Sub Zero to undergo the same progress.

Like the series protagonist <a href=\"/link/3005-191/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-191\">Link</a>, she is not a single character, but numerous characters that appear throughout the Legend of Zelda timeline that share common traits and characteristics. She is most commonly depicted as the presiding princess of the fictional land of <a href=\"/hyrule/3035-13/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-13\">Hyrule</a>. Her creator, <a href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-614\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, has been quoted as saying that her name was inspired by the wife of writer F. Scott Fitzgerald.</p><p>Zelda traditionally represents one of the three pieces of the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/triforce/93-18/\">Triforce</a>; specifically, the Triforce of Wisdom, for her wise and benevolent nature. The other pieces of the Triforce, the Triforces of Courage and Power, are traditionally represented by Link and <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/ganon/94-512/\">Ganon</a>, respectively.</p><p>Despite the franchise's title, Princess Zelda does not actually appear in every Zelda game. <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening/3030-3645/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3645\">Link's Awakening</a>, for example, only makes a fleeting reference to her existence, but otherwise she is not mentioned, nor does she appear. Likewise, in the Game Boy Color Zelda games <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-seasons/3030-5895/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5895\">Oracle of Seasons</a> and <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-oracle-of-ages/3030-8004/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-8004\">Oracle of Ages</a>, there is almost no mention of Princess Zelda in the main plot. The two games must be played in succession with the use of the password system that connects them in order to reveal the overall plot of the games, and Zelda's connection to it.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><h3>Personality</h3><p>Zelda first appears in the game <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\">The Legend of Zelda</a> as a <a href=\"/damsel-in-distress/3015-100/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-100\">damsel in distress</a>, having being captured and held prisoner by the evil Ganon. Princess Zelda's only hope is to be rescued by the protagonist, Link. Prior to her capture, however, she has the forethought to break the Triforce of Wisdom into eight pieces and scatter them across Hyrule to prevent Ganon from claiming it for himself. Later games in the Legend of Zelda series expand on these basic themes in varying ways.</p><p>Unlike Link, who is a silent protagonist, Zelda is commonly portrayed with speaking roles. The specifics of her personality tends to vary between incarnations, as each has her own history. Some, such as the Zelda seen in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds/3030-42402/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-42402\">The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</a>, are warm, gentle, and kind, while the Zelda depicted in <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/3030-19467/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-19467\">Twilight Princess</a> is much more mature, somber and serious.</p><h3>Appearance</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95666/1909160-zelda_ocarina_of_time.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909160\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 234px\" data-ratio=\"2.5641025641026\" data-width=\"234\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:256.4%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/95666/1909160-zelda_ocarina_of_time.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909160\"><img alt=\"Zelda's \"older\" Ocarina of Time design.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/95666/1909160-zelda_ocarina_of_time.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/9/95666/1909160-zelda_ocarina_of_time.png 234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 234px) 100vw, 234px\" data-width=\"234\"></a><figcaption>Zelda's \"older\" Ocarina of Time design.</figcaption></figure><p>Though incarnations of Zelda exist in which she is not depicted as royalty, her incarnations as a princess bear a number of common characteristics. A member of the Hylian race, she has long, elf-like ears. She also typically has blue eyes, though her hair has been depicted as a variety of colors, including red, brunette, and varying shades of blonde.</p><p>Princess Zelda commonly wears an ornate circlet of some design on her forehead, as well as a dress comprised of white and colors ranging in varying shades of violet and purple. The dress is also commonly adorned with the emblem of the Triforce.</p><p>Zelda has been depicted as varying ages, depending on the game. Some, such as <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/3030-18508/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-18508\">The Wind Waker</a>, cast her as a young girl, whereas in Twilight Princess, she's an older teenager. In <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">Ocarina of Time</a>, which features a story that sends Link forward and backward in time, she is depicted as both a youth of about ten and a young woman of about seventeen.</p><p> </p><h2>Depictions of Zelda</h2><p>As numerous incarnations of Zelda have come to exist, some have also come to bear alter-egos and hidden histories. Below are some examples.</p><h3>Sheik</h3><h4>Ocarina of Time</h4><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1787376\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 400px\" data-ratio=\"0.5975\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1787376\"><img alt=\"Sheik in Ocarina of Time\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg 400w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Sheik in Ocarina of Time\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg 400w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1787376-zoot_pr_050811_05.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sheik in Ocarina of Time</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>, the supposedly male Sheik helps Link by giving him hints about where to go and teaching him the songs for <a href=\"/teleportation/3015-8/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8\">teleporting</a> to the temples on his harp.

This leads to Tetra aiding Link in his quest throughout the game, offering reluctant help when Link is in need. She uses a gossip stone to communicate to him. It is later revealed in the submerged <a href=\"/hyrule-castle/3035-1765/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1765\">Hyrule Castle</a> that Tetra is, in fact, the direct descendant of Princess Zelda. With this new knowledge, Tetra/Zelda is endowed with the Triforce of Wisdom and its powers. Her identity now revealed, Ganondorf kidnaps Zelda and takes her to his castle, where Link must rescue her in the final stage of the game. Once freed, she aids Link in defeating Ganon by firing <a href=\"/light-arrows/3055-540/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-540\">Light Arrows</a> (an item that is used by Zelda in many titles) at Link, which he must deflect with his shield.</p><h4><a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-hourglass/3030-3666/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-3666\">Phantom Hourglass</a></h4><p>Despite being the direct sequel to Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass features a pirate-garbed Tetra. Although she and her crew now knows her heritage, she would rather remain known as Tetra, captain of her ship and band of pirates than as Princess Zelda of Hyrule. In the opening cutscene, Tetra is captured by the <a href=\"/ghost-ship/3015-5081/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5081\">Ghost Ship</a>, prompting Link to launch into a valiant quest to save her. Later, it's revealed that she has been turned to stone. Link then has to defeat <a href=\"/vaati/3005-852/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-852\">Gufuu</a>, to turn her back into her standard form.</p><h3>The First Zelda</h3><h4>Skyward Sword</h4><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-2650712\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.png\" data-size=\"small\" data-align=\"right\" style=\"width: 909px\" data-ratio=\"0.64466446644664\" data-width=\"909\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2650712\"><img alt=\"Pages from the Skyward Sword prequel manga published in Hyrule Historia depicting Zelda's divine origin, Hylia.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.png 909w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Pages from the Skyward Sword prequel manga published in Hyrule Historia depicting Zelda's divine origin, Hylia.\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.png 909w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.jpg 480w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6228/2650712-hyrule%20historia%20manga%20page.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Pages from the Skyward Sword prequel manga published in Hyrule Historia depicting Zelda's divine origin, Hylia.</figcaption></figure><p>The first Zelda is not a princess, nor does Hyrule as a land yet exist when she is born.

Her design in the game meshes more traditional dress elements with pieces of armor.</p><p>Hyrule Warriors marks the first time in the series that Zelda is Queen of Hyrule. The decision to cast her as queen in the game was based on the thought that the increased power in station was a better fit for her role in the story.

Each form has a completely different set of moves and abilities.</p><p>Princess Zelda is also playable in <a href=\"/super-smash-bros-brawl/3030-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20588\">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>, and again can shift back and forth between her Zelda and Sheik personae. Zelda's design in this game is based on her appearance in Twilight Princess, and as such, Sheik's visual design was tweaked to reflect her being an alternate persona of the Twlight Princess Zelda.</p><p>In <a href=\"/super-smash-bros/3030-35573/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35573\">Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and NIntendo 3DS</a>, Zelda and Sheik are once again playable. However, they are now separate characters with completely independent abilities and attributes, and cannot transform from one incarnation to the other.</p><h2>Voice Actresses</h2><p>Though The Legend of Zelda traditionally does not feature full voice acting, Zelda has been given voice with various vocal sounds such as grunts, laughs and gasps since Ocarina of Time. Actresses that have portrayed Zelda in such a manner include the following:</p><ul><li>Ocarina of Time: <a href=\"/jun-mizusawa/3040-104104/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-104104\">Jun Mizusawa</a></li><li>The Wind Waker and Phantom Hourglass: <a href=\"/hikari-tachibana/3040-90379/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-90379\">Hikari Tachibana</a></li><li>Spirit Tracks: Akane Omae</li><li>Skyward Sword: Yuu Shimamura</li></ul><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>As a fan of the The Legend of Zelda series, actor and comedian <a href=\"/robin-williams/3040-55806/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-55806\">Robin Williams</a> named his daughter after the titular princess. Robin and Zelda Williams also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqebeDRMTDQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">appeared in a commercial together</a> to promote <a href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d/3030-31776/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-31776\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> for the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a>.</li><li>Of the three unofficial Zelda <a href=\"/cd-i/3045-27/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-27\">CD-i</a> games produced by Phillips, Zelda is the playable character in the latter two: <a href=\"/zelda-the-wand-of-gamelon/3030-17713/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17713\">Zelda: The Wand of Gamelon</a> and <a href=\"/zeldas-adventure/3030-14181/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-14181\">Zelda's Adventure</a>.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Zangief first appeared in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-243\" href=\"/street-fighter-ii/3030-243/\" slug=\"street-fighter-ii\">Street Fighter II</a>, and has made subsequent appearances in other games in the franchise. Zangief hails from Mother Russia, (Except in SF2: The World Warriors, where it was the Soviet Union), and his fighting style is wrestling/grappling.</p><p>Zangief's name is possibly based on real-life pro wrestler Victor Zangiev, a former Soviet amateur who trained as a professional in NJPW, who also competed in WCW and UWF International. Zangief's prototypical name was Vodka Gobalsky. Zangief's biography apparently plays upon the association between Stalinist regimes and state-funded athletics programs utilising body-building drugs following the domination of the 1954 World Weightlifting Championships by the Soviet Union.</p><h2>Gameplay Characteristics</h2><p>Zangief's fighting style is unique in Street Fighter II in that he uses a variety of wrestling throws and grapples to engage his opponents. He does not throw any <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3\" href=\"/projectile/3015-3/\" slug=\"projectile\">projectiles</a>, and therefore is much more effective if used at close range. He is also the first fighting game character to ever use a 360-degree motion for a move. Once at arm's length, Zangief has a number of moves that can deal devastating amounts of damage to an opponent.</p><h2>Special Moves</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35324/1321048-ssf2xj_04_09_110058.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1321048\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.58333333333333\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.3%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/35324/1321048-ssf2xj_04_09_110058.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1321048\"><img alt=\"Spinning piledriver\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/35324/1321048-ssf2xj_04_09_110058.png\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/35324/1321048-ssf2xj_04_09_110058.png 384w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px\" data-width=\"384\"></a><figcaption>Spinning piledriver</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-331\" href=\"/street-fighter/3025-331/\" slug=\"street-fighter\">Street Fighter franchise</a>, Zangief has used a number of special moves that have increased and decreased in power, as the character list is balanced. His special moves include:</p><ul><li><b>Spinning Pile Driver:</b> While the command for this move is widely described as a 360 motion, it is actually performed by pressing the four principle directions(left, down, right, up) in any clockwise or anticlockwise order, before pressing punch. This holds true for all \"360\" moves in Street Fighter.</li><li><b>Spinning Clothesline:</b> Hit all three punch buttons at the same time.</li><li><b>Fast Spinning Clothesline:</b> Hit all three kick buttons at the same time.</li><li><b>Banishing Flat:</b> Do a shoryuken motion and punch.</li><li><b>Siberian Suplex:</b> Do a 360-degree motion w/ the joystick, then press kick at the end (only at close range).</li><li><b>Running Power Bomb:</b> Do a 360-degree motion w/ the joystick, then press kick at the end (anywhere but directly next to the opponent, else you get a siberian suplex).</li></ul><h2>Super/Ultra Moves (Super Street Fighter 4)</h2><ul><li><b>Super Move: Final Atomic Buster:</b> Do a 720-degree motion w/ the joystick, then press punch at the end.</li><li><b>Ultra 1:</b> <b>Ultimate Atomic Buster</b>: Do a 720-degree motion w/ the joystick, then press the three punch buttons at the end.</li><li><b>Ultra 2:</b> <b>Siberian Blizzard</b>: Do a 720-degree motion w/ the joystick in the air, then press the three kick buttons at the end.</li></ul><h2>Biography</h2><p>As the greatest professional wrestler in the Soviet Union, Zangief was contacted by a man referred to as Erai Hito (Great Man) to represent his country in the second World Warrior tournament; this individual clearly resembles former Soviet leader and President, Mikhail Gorbachev.</p><p>Zangief agreed and began training in the extreme climates of Siberia. He built his strength by wrestling polar bears, gaining many fearsome scars in the process. His trademark Spinning Piledriver was created after being picked up by a cyclone while performing a piledriver on a bear. With the assistance of his government, Zangief emerged from his training as \"The Red Cyclone\", determined to demonstrate Russia's magnificent power to all of the world.</p><p>A patriot through and through, Zangief opposed the activities of Shadaloo. During the course of his battles, Zangief would come to meet one of his biggest fans, the Japanese pro wrestler R. Mika, co-operate with the Sumo wrestler E. Honda to destroy M. Bison's Psycho Drive, co-operate with X-Man Colossus against Omega Red, and dance with his Gorbachev - like benefactor after winning the World Warrior tournament; in later editions in the Street Fighter II series, Zangief calls him \"Mr. Ex-President\", yet Zangief is listed as being from the USSR, making it unclear as to whether these events take place before or after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Most of the above events are considered non-canon, as they contradict the versions of events pertaining to central characters, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-103\" href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" slug=\"ryu\">Ryu</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3409\" href=\"/charlie/3005-3409/\" slug=\"charlie\">Charlie Nash</a>.</p><p>Though some have speculated about Zangief's sexual orientation, Capcom representatives have confirmed that Zangief is a straight man. The speculation came to a head over his biography in the Alpha series listing his dislikes as \"beautiful women\" and him having a custom intro with Eagle (A Freddie Mercury Tribute character) in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8680\" href=\"/street-fighter-alpha-3-max/3030-8680/\" slug=\"street-fighter-alpha-3-max\">Street Figher Alpha MAX</a>.</p><h2>Mecha Zangief</h2><p><a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/28/557230-evil_super.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/0/28/557230-evil_thumb.gif\"/></a></p><p>Mecha Zangief is a sprite variation of Zangief in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-513\" href=\"/marvel-vs-capcom/3025-513/\" slug=\"marvel-vs-capcom\">Marvel vs.</a>series. He is extremely heavy and almost impervious to any attack (animation wise; Mecha Zangief rarely gets stunned. However, he does receive adequate damage.) He's also able to breathe blue flames (\"Vodka Fire\")</p><p>Mecha Zangief is available in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9309\" href=\"/marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter/3030-9309/\" slug=\"marvel-super-heroes-vs-street-fighter\">Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</a> via a simple cheat code and as a transformation in <a data-ref-id=\"3025-513\" href=\"/marvel-vs-capcom/3025-513/\" slug=\"marvel-vs-capcom\">Marvel Vs.

      "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Yoda is a Jedi master of an unknown race from the <a href=\"/star-wars/3025-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars universe</a>. Having trained Jedi for more than 500 years, he is considered one of the wisest masters ever to have lived. His video game appearances include most licensed Star Wars games, considering his high fan-popularity and long lifespan. He is one of the most influential fictional movie characters of all time.</p><p>Not much is known about Yoda's past nor his species since they are so long lived and so scarce. However, this does not impede Yoda's impact on events in Star Wars. Yoda is a teacher at heart and has taught many, most notably taking <a href=\"/count-dooku/3005-5119/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-5119\">Count Dooku</a>, <a href=\"/ki-adi-mundi/3005-3788/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3788\">Ki-Adi-Mundi</a>, and <a href=\"/mace-windu/3005-3783/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-3783\">Mace Windu</a> as a Padawan. He also oversees many younglings, who are children who are force-sensitive, and teaches them many ways of the force. Alongside this, he gives advice to almost every single influential character in the Star Wars saga, making him one of the most important characters in the Star Wars franchise.</p><h2>Impact on the Star Wars Saga</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1465854-yoda1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465854\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.80851063829787\" data-width=\"376\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 376px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.9%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1465854-yoda1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1465854\"><img alt=\"Yoda in the midst of a Force Push\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1465854-yoda1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/2/22435/1465854-yoda1.jpg 376w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px\" data-width=\"376\"></a><figcaption>Yoda in the midst of a Force Push</figcaption></figure><p>In the prequel trilogies, Yoda is seen as a wise mentor, often at the Jedi temple teaching and giving out advice.

In Episode II: The Attack of the Clones, Yoda takes on his old Padawan, Count Dooku and his combat abilities are seen on screen for the first time throughout the movies. Shown to have the ability to re-direct force lightning and the acrobatics to properly engage anyone in a lightsaber duel, he winds up saving the lives of Anakin and Obi-Wan who are both beaten by Dooku, albeit at the cost of Dooku's escape. Yoda acts as a general throughout the Clone Wars and take parts in many engagements, including the Battle of Kashyyyk Finally, in Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith, Yoda sees the fall of the Jedi Order, after the betrayal of Anakin Skywalker and takes on Darth Sidious in the galactic Senate. The outcome, ultimately deciding the fate o the universe.

He is seen teachin g him the ways of the force through rigorous training, albeit reluctantly due to Luke's similar traits to his father, Anakin Skywalker. However, thei r training is cut short as Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in an attempt to save his friends in the cloud city of Bespin. In Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi, Luke returns to the Dagobah system to a Yoda on his death bed. Yoda gives sage advice, and tells Luke that there is another Skywalker. As Yoda begins to die, he fades into oblivion and becomes one with the force. He is later seen, when the Empire is beaten standing next to Anakin Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi as a force ghost.</p><p>There is no doubt that Yoda was one of the most powerful and influential members of the Jedi Order. He is even referenced as the life-blood of the Order during the time he was present. He was seen as a very grandfatherly figure who cared for everything. He lived up to 900 years, and still retains his identity in the Force by becoming a Force ghost, essentially achieving a version of immortality. </p><p>Over thirty years later, his Force ghost appeared before Luke.</p><h2>Famous Quotes</h2><ul><li>\"Do or do not.

However, his parents did not know he was a mutant, to bring their son joy, his parents hired a girl named Rose to keep him happy. Under Rose's care, they would go on outings and James would play with a young boy called 'Dog'. Logan, the son of Thomas Logan who was the grounds keeper for the Howlett mansion. The Logans lived in a small shack on the poor side of town. Thomas was an abusive alcoholic who had a strong hate for the Howletts, especially John Howlett. At first, it seemed that Thomas hated the Howletts because of their possessions, later, it was revealed that he was, in fact, having an affair with Elizabeth. Later on, Dog tries to force himself on Rose and rape her, then also killed James’ pet dog. Afterwards when John finds this out he fires Thomas immediately. This only makes Thomas resent John even more, and in a drunken rage, with his son and with rifles, breaks into the property. Thomas tries to convince Elizabeth to run away with him, but John comes into the room and the two engage in a fight. James is awoken by the noise and runs into the room, only to see Thomas shoot his dad dead. James was horrified and traumatized when he sees his father killed which results in the mutation of claws to manifests. James, angered at his father’s killer, jumps and attacks Thomas, killing him in the process. James then proceeds to scar his son, Dog. Rose, confused on what to do flees with James. The police are later summoned to the mansion, and \"Dog\" blames the murder entirely on Rose.</p><p>Rose was wanted for the murder of the Howletts, and James was exiled by his grandfather.

As time passes by, his mutant abilities and his physical build develops and he is dubbed the Wolverine by his fellow miners. However, James' grandfather is on his death bed, and summons Dog to look for him. James' grandfather originally exiled him, but he had a change of heart and wanted to see his grandson. When Dog finally found him, both James and Dog engaged in a fight. Just as they are about to fight, Wolverine extended his claws and Rose is knocked into the fight by the crowd, and impales herself.

A <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Sadist/\">sadist</a>, Cyber kills Logan’s girlfriend, a woman named Janet. The two men fight and during the battle, Cyber defeats Logan and gouges out his left eye. Afterwards, Cyber and Sabretooth track him down. They find a feral Logan in the woods and convince him to return. He does so and is sent overseas to <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Madripoor/\">Madripoor</a> where he meets a woman named Seraph. It is here that Logan develops his “Patch” persona. While fighting in Belgium on April 22, 1915, Logan encounters a being called Lazaer. Lazaer is armed with a large broadsword and has been using it to kill soldiers on the same</p><p>battlefield. They soon begin to fight one another, with Lazaer initially gaining the upper hand. After being impaled with Lazaer's sword, Logan pulls it from his chest and stabs it through the chest of his surprised opponent.

After his training with Ogun, Logan travels to the village of Bando Saburo in order to learn how to be a man. There, he meets and falls in love with a local woman named <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Itsu_%28comics%29/\">Itsu</a>. They are married and conceive a child together. After an explosion caused by the demon swordsmith <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Muramasa/\">Muramasa</a> causes Logan to accidentally stab a villager with his claws, he is banned from the village. Before he leaves, Logan finds Itsu murdered.

Sabretooth murders Janice after realizing that Logan has recovered his emotions and conscience, reminding Logan that whenever he strays from a or the narrow path his unseen masters have laid out for him, innocents, most often the women he loves, inevitably die. Logan learns that he is a mutant and resigns from Team X. He then joins the Canadian Defense Ministry. On one occasion, Logan works with Richard and Mary Parker, government agents and parents of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Spider-Man/\">Peter Parker</a>. Logan also first meets <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Carol_Danvers/\">Carol Danvers</a> during this time and works with her on a number of occasions.</p><h2><i>Weapon X</i></h2><p>Wolverine had become a drifter who was discharged from the army because he shot a fellow soldier on the shooting range. He is suffering from amnesia and has trouble remembering anything from his past. Logan later goes to a bar where he is eventually drugged. Wolverine was being taken into the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/weapon-x/5018/\">Weapon X</a> program.</p><p>It was a facility in Canada ran by a man known as 'The Professor', Dr. Abraham Cornelius, and Carol Hines. Wolverine was shaved all around his body when Cornelius noticed his hair was re-growing at an accelerated speed. They also realized that their drug was starting to wear off too quickly. They continued to drug him until he could no longer do anything at all, then they proceeded to changing him into Weapon X. His bones were laced with <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/adamantium/40759/\">Adamantium</a> and he was brainwashed into a killing machine. They also altered his memories by giving him false memories so he could not trace it back to them.

Wolverine had regressed to a purely animalistic state, but the Hudsons took him under their care, and brought his human personality to the surface once more. Wolverine already had his adamantium claws and skeleton at this point. He became a soldier and secret agent for the Canadian government, and eventually adopted the code-name Wolverine. He was to become the leader of Alpha Flight himself, but instead he left to join the new team of X-Men that was being organized.</p><p>Logan is eventually discovered by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Guardian_%28Marvel_Comics%29/\">James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Vindicator_%28comics%29/\">Heather Hudson</a>, who help him recover his humanity.

Logan becomes Wolverine, one of Canada's first superheroes.

Another documented Department H mission is Wolverine's involvement in a hostage situation in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Iraq/\">Iraq</a>. Iraqi militants and a group of hired mercenaries seized an American embassy in Iraq and took hostages, giving various ransom demands. Because there are Canadian hostages in the embassy, Wolverine is dispatched to handle the situation, along with an American/Canadian Delta Force. The reclaiming of the embassy is successful. However, following the battle, Wolverine finds a Canadian nun dying from a bullet wound she received in the crossfire. She tells him about how the hired American mercenaries had harassed her daily and subjected her to extreme psychological torture. Wolverine promises the nun he would avenge the suffering, and years later he hunts down the mercenaries in North America and kills them.

Wolverine was one of these recruits and after he helps save the other team, he would remain on the X-Men for several more missions. During his time on the X-Men he would clash with <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> many times due to their mutual interest in <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>. Wolverine became romantically attracted to Jean because of her resemblance to his late mother, Rose. Later James Hudson (Vindicator) would seek Wolverine and try and return him back to Department H, with force if necessary. However, Vindicator would be easily defeated and, as he leaves, he promises that he will be back for Logan. Logan would later meet a woman named <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mariko-yashida/29-3196/\">Mariko Yashida</a> who was the heir to the Yakuza family. Logan would eventually fall in love with Mariko. Vindicator would return for Wolverine, but this time as the leader of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a>.

Poisoning almost all the X-Men, Viper and Samurai would have succeeded in their mission if it weren't for Rogue and Wolverine stopping them. The wedding was to be a few days afterwards, but at the last minute Mariko called it off, as she was being controlled by Mastermind.</p><p>When <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>’s father, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/carmen-pryde/29-31402/\">Carmen Pryde</a>, was said to have been in trouble with the Yakuza, Wolverine accompanies Kitty to Japan. There, they encounter Wolverine’s former mentor named Ogun. Ogun later was able to possess Kitty but with Logan’s aid, she was able to force Ogun out of her body. After this event, Wolverine and Kitty have become very close with a big brother/mentor type of relationship. Later Mariko would get married and Wolverine still had feelings for her. She tried to use Wolverine to kill her father but later decides that she cannot talk to him because his claws were unsheathed was dishonorable. Later Mariko’s husband would be killed, and Wolverine regains his honor by beating her father in combat.

While in the Savage Land, Wolverine becomes romantically involved with the female chieftain named Gahck. Eventually he would discover a robot Apocalypse and destroy it. Wolverine returns to America and begins to head off to Canada. While in Canada, he finally discovers that his current memories were all implanted and false. This caused his personality to become a much darker character. Next, Wolverine travels to Japan and tries to reconcile with Mariko. She refused to love him again until her clan can stop doing illegal activities. Later a Yakuza assassin would poison Mariko and it was revealed to be at the order of Matsu’o Tsurayaba. Mariko would beg Wolverine to kill her quickly so she does not suffer a slow death from the poison. Wolverine’s personality took a turn again when Mariko dies in his arms, this is the reason why Wolverine has become so emotionally distant. After Mariko’s death, Wolverine swore to Tsurayaba that on every anniversary of Mariko’s death, Wolverine will visit him and cut off a piece of his body until there is nothing left.</p><p>Later Wolverine was reunited with Sabretooth, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/maverick/29-8307/\">Maverick</a>, Silver Fox, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/john-wraith/29-17653/\">John Wraith</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mastodon/29-27460/\">Mastodon</a>.

Right before Ferro dies, he forces Sabretooth to kill Silver Fox. Wolverine suffers a mental breakdown after Silver Fox died and it accumulated with the death of Mariko and the tampering of his brain. He began thinking he was on another Team X mission to assassinate a man named Terry Adams. Wolverine was able to break into a Russian space program. He meets Epsilon Red, who is a powerful psychic and also the Terry Wolverine was supposed to assassinate. Instead, Wolverine actually helped free him and in return he helped break down Wolverine’s mental barriers, now Wolverine was able to tell which memories were false and which were real.</p><p>In the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/fatal-attractions/39-41878/\">Fatal Attractions</a> story arc, Wolverine’s adamantium was extracted by Magneto. This injured Wolverine so badly that his healing factor could not keep up trying to keep him alive. Wolverine would eventually heal but without his adamantium now, and as a result of the serious injuries due to the extraction, his strength, stamina, agility, and reflexes were weakened. Wolverine could not accept the fact that he was severely weakened after Fatal Attractions, he began training day and night in the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a> to try and regain his old abilities. This revealed that his claws were his bones and that they were naturally apart of him. Also since they are no longer laced with adamantium, his bones are not sharp enough to pierce through cleanly, which results in damaged skin on his knuckles and massive blood loss every time he extracts the claws. Finally accepting his loss in strength and power, he decides to go on a solo adventure and left Jubilee a note explaining himself.</p><p>Eventually Wolverine would return to the X-Mansion when he discovered that Sabretooth had been staying there. Wolverine returns and begins to fight Sabretooth, the fight ends when Wolverine stabs Sabretooth in the brain which caused him brain damage until it fully healed. Now back at the X-Mansion, Professor Xavier, along with <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> and Heather Hudson, researched Wolverine’s body and mutation. They discover that his heightened senses and healing factor was slowly increasing in power. They discovered that when Wolverine’s skeleton was laced with adamantium, his mutation had stopped. They also reveal that his healing factor had in fact been healing at a slow pace due to the adamantium’s toxicity, it forced his healing factor to constantly heal the poison from the adamantium. Therefore, as time goes by Wolverine’s healing factor would become much more stronger and be able to heal him even if something is cut off.</p><h2><i>Adamantium Again</i></h2><p>Later <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/genesis/29-25193/\">Genesis</a> would kidnap Wolverine and attempt to re-bond Wolverine with adamantium again in order to transform him into one of <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/horsemen-of-apocalypse/65-40423/\">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a>. However, Genesis was unsuccessful and it caused Wolverine to transform into a more feral personality that acted on animal instincts. Wolverine, now in feral stage, kills the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/dark-riders/65-41074/\">Dark Riders</a> and Genesis. Later he is encountered by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/stick/29-11018/\">Stick</a>, who help him regain his humanity and was able to change him back to normal. Wolverine would continue his life without adamantium for some time. Eventually Wolverine would be kidnapped by Apocalypse, who offers to re-bond Wolverine with adamantium. Apocalypse then sets up a fight between him and Sabretooth to decide who the new Death would be. Wolverine accepts the fight because he does not want Sabretooth to be let loose as the Horseman of Death. Wolverine defeats Sabretooth and becomes the new Horseman of Death. Apocalypse then extracts the adamantium in Sabretooth and re-bonded it to Wolverine’s skeleton. Wolverine was sent to battle the X-Men but would eventually break free from Apocalypse’s control with the help of Jubilee.</p><p>During Grant Morrison’s run on New X-Men, it was revealed that the X in Weapon X was a roman numeral. This meant Wolverine was possibly the tenth weapon, although the Weapon X program developed many more super-beings. It was also revealed that Captain America was the first weapon (Weapon I). Wolverine would also discover that the Weapon program continued to create more weapons, the latest was <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/ultimaton/29-41077/\">Ultimaton</a> - Weapon XV. Wolverine and Cyclops defeat Weapon XV and Wolverine learns his true identity. Wolverine was able to gain access to the Weapon X files and he learns that he was created to be a living killing machine. He also discovered that he was sent into a small town where he killed everybody. This caused Wolverine to believe that his only purpose in life was to kill, but with the help of Jean Grey, he was able to snap out of his current mental state.</p><p>Later Wolverine was brainwashed by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hydra/65-3480/\">Hydra</a> into working for them as an assassin. He killed many heroes during this time, among those were <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hornet/29-4803/\">Hornet</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/slingers/65-43529/\">Slingers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a> who was resurrected by HYDRA and also brainwashed into working for them. Eventually he was able to break free from their control and helped <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> bring them down.</p><p>Next, Wolverine was recruited to join the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a>. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> wanted to recruit Wolverine because of what happened during <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Avengers Disassembled</a>. He believed that if someone with powers like <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> were to go rogue, Wolverine would not hesitate in killing them.</p><p>After <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>, Wolverine was able to recover all of his memories. The governments of the United States and Canada found out and began to panic because of their involvement in his life. Expecting Wolverine to come seeking for revenge, they destroyed every written document that involved Wolverine. However, Wolverine would proceed in finding more answers in the story arc 'Origins &amp; Endings'. Wolverine began searching for a weapon called the Muramasa Blade. He confronts the Silver Samurai for answers, but he refuses and the two engage in a battle. In the end Silver Samurai had stabbed Wolverine, but Wolverine breaks free by cutting off one of Silver Samurai’s hand. He tells him about <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Bucky Barnes</a>’s (Winter Soldier and the current Captain America) involvement in Wolverine’s escape from the Weapon X program. Wolverine would confront Bucky where he admitted to Logan that he killed one of his pregnant Japanese wife but was under mind control at the time. Wolverine remembers how he met Itsu after World War II. It began with Ogun taking Wolverine in as his pupil and trained him. Ogun had sent Wolverine to a village where Bando Saburo would team him to regain his humanity. That is where Wolverine met Itsu, and the two would conceive a child. Bucky would kill Itsu when he was under mind control and Wolverine would believe that it was the people of the village that murdered her. Wolverine would ally himself with a man named Muramasa, who created the Muramasa blade for Wolverine. After finally remembering what the Muramasa blade is, he returns to Muramasa’s mountains and takes back his sword from Muramasa.</p><h2><i>Civil War</i></h2><p>After <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a> exploded in Stamford, Connecticut, Wolverine went on a mission after Nitro. He was eventually able to track down Nitro where the two would begin to battle. Wolverine beats Nitro until he is interrupted by Atlantean agents that were ordered by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> to retrieve Nitro (Nitro had killed Namor’s cousin, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/namorita/29-2113/\">Namorita</a>). Wolverine declined to hand Nitro over to them when Namor arrives. Wolverine tries to engage against him but is knocked unconscious. When Wolverine regained consciousness, he was able to borrow an underwater armor from <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> and went after Nitro. When Wolverine was able to see Nitro, he decided to leave him there with Namor. Namor would reveal to Wolverine that he had gained more power from a drug called Mutant Growth Hormone. Wolverine goes on several missions during the Civil War to try and rid evil.</p><h2><i>Wolverine: Origins</i></h2><p>This series launched right after Wolverine’s Origin &amp; Endings story arc. It follows Wolverine as he now remembers his entire past, and is going to exact his revenge on those responsible. Wolverine begins in a government facility in which he is trying to find information. He is then attacked by a Shiva robot and Wolverine easily defeats it with the Muramasa Blade. The government then decides to release <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/nuke/29-41866/\">Nuke</a> (Frank Simpson) to fight Wolverine. In the process Wolverine discovers another hidden part from his memory in which it reveals that Wolverine was responsible for turning Nuke into the person he his today. Wolverine would defeat Nuke when he would engage against Captain America, who was sent to stop Wolverine. <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> was able to steal away the Muramasa Blade from Wolverine and slashed him in the stomach. Then <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\">Hellions</a> come and stops Wolverine before he can try and kill Captain America. Emma was then able to discover the Wolverine’s son was still alive and she reveals it to him. She also reveals that he does not have any thoughts that are readable just like Wolverine. Emma tries to talk Wolverine out of his mission to go after his son instead, but Wolverine decides that the people he is after could go after his son and brainwash him. Wolverine then gives Cyclops the Muramasa Blade and tells him to use it on Wolverine when the time comes.</p><p>Wolverine returns to America to find his friend Maverick. He was able to track down Maverick to a building where refugee mutants that both still had their abilities and those that don’t are taking shelter there together. Wolverine discovers that Jubilee was there but they are interrupted by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/omega-red/29-9729/\">Omega Red</a> crashing into the building demanding Maverick to tell him where the carbonadium synthesizer is. Wolverine then engages against Omega Red in order to give time for Maverick and Jubilee to evacuate the other mutants. Omega Red would be able to overpower Wolverine and threw him through the building which knocked him unconscious. Wolverine then hears Jubilee scream and Wolverine would rush back to her. He finds a wounded Maverick who tells Wolverine that he had told Omega Red where the carbonadium synthesizer was and he took Jubilee with him. Wolverine goes through a bunch of memories when he arrives at Berlin. He would meet up with Black Widow but eventually Wolverine would get captured. While being held captive, someone comes in and kills all the guards and slashes Wolverine in the stomach, Wolverine would pass out.</p><p>Wolverine leaves the facility, and is tailed by his son, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/daken/29-42501/\">Daken</a> (Daken is the one who cut open his stomach.) He continues to tail his father. He continues to tail Wolverine into a bank vault, the holding place of the carbonadium synthesizer. Daken begins a bloody battle with Wolverine, where it seems that Daken has the upper hand. The fight is interrupted when <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cyber/29-7597/\">Cyber</a> breaks through the wall and challenges Daken. They fought for a while but when Cyber took advantage of the fight and is about to kill Daken, he pulled Cyber out, letting his son escaped. Cyber then attacked Wolverine but suffered a heart attack before he could continue. Logan was told that Cyber trained his son in the field of combat, he got this information in exchange for saving Cyber's life.</p><p>Wolverine decides to go to a museum dedicated to Captain America to reflect on his first meeting with him during the second World War. Before leaving, Wolverine goes to a storage locker and put something in a particular locker, which was owned by Bucky. When he opened his locker, he finds 3 sniper bullets and a letter which states, \"Bucky, will let you know who and when\", signed with a \"L\".</p><p>The mercenary Deadpool was hired to kill Wolverine by a mysterious party willing to pay big money. Deadpool accepted, possibly still mad at Wolverine for gutting him recently, Deadpool actually planed his attack first he ambushed Logan in a city, first he shot, maimed and blew up Logan and then used an AIM device to attach Wolverine to a passing subway cart and drag him down a street at very high speed this gave Deadpool a chance to prep for his next assault. When Wolverine gets free he is in berserker rage, Deadpool was ready for this but he was not counting on Wolverine cutting off a large chunk of Wade’s hand off and Wolverine started to savagely slashing Deadpool, while during the fight, a woman started screaming for help next to a burning car, Wolverine ran over to help, slicing open the car door which caused a back draft which badly burnt Logan, Logan recovered in seconds, Logan went to save the baby in the front seat to Logan’s surprise the baby was a doll which blew up in his face. Deadpool had paid the woman to do this to and gave her a little bit more on top on the fee the agreed because she did a convincing scream. However Deadpool underestimated Wolverine’s healing factor, Logan was up and plunged his claws into Deadpool’s chest but didn’t hit anything vital, Deadpool managed to left his gun with a re-grown hand, put it under Logan’s chin and fire, both men slumped together neither standing or falling.</p><p>Deadpool suffered the less damage so he healed quicker, when Logan woke up he was suspended over a pool of water, tied up and hand cuffed with no way to escape, Deadpool intended to drown Wolverine but just before Deadpool could pull the leaver he got his hand cut off by Daken, who had waited to the last moment to make his presence known, Deadpool had little to react other than telling Daken that 1985 wanted its hair back. Daken pulled the leaver sending Wolverine into the water, this annoyed Deadpool and the two begin to fight, Daken quickly gained the upper hand, during the fight Daken kicks two of Deadpool’s grenades into the pool and freed Logan, the fight continued, Daken slaughtered Deadpool by cutting both of his hands off and savagely slashed him in the chest and stomach, taking him out of the confrontation. Daken went and confronted but before he can say anything Daken is shot with one of the three Carbonadium bullets made out of what was left of the Carbonadium Synthesizer which was used to make a new pacemaker for Cyber.</p><p>Logan picks Daken up in his arms and starts to walk towards the door, Logan comes across a bloody Deadpool’ Logan tells him that him and Bucky set him up to draw out Daken and that he let Deadpool catch him, just before Logan leaves with his son he tell Deadpool that if he comes near him or his son he will kill him. While walking to meet Bucky, starts to talk to Daken [who is unconscious still] “There’s a rifle slug lodged in your brain. It’s made o’ Carbonadium. Its gonna keep your healin’ factor from kickin’ in. Not forever just long enough for me to take you someplace secure. It took almost took me a hundred years for me to get my own mind back. Now, I’m gonna get your back too.” The story is continuing.</p><p><b>MANIFEST DESTINY</b></p><p>Wolverine travels to china town to settle an old dept that is 50 years old, for unknown reasons [50 years ago] all that is known is that wolverine worked for and in the end fought the head of the Chinese crime, Black Dragon and his group but Logan also did some committed some sort of betrayal and was ordered to never return or he will die. So now 50 years later with the X-men now based in San Francisco Wolverine returns to China Town and is instantly noticed by a swordsman named Lo Jan. Lo Jan confronts Wolverine but before the two can fight, Lo Jan is shot in the back by the a woman called Lin, Lin is Wolverine’s old girlfriend and the current Black Dragon, it is also hinted at that it was Lin who Wolverine betrayed 50 years ago.</p><p>Black Dragon revels her four Kung Fu warriors, Rock of the Buddha, Fist of Fire, Storm Sword and Soultaker.

Po offers Wolverine a chance for him [Po] to train Logan, which happily accepts. The story is ongoing.</p><h2><i>Messiah Complex</i></h2><p>Wolverine is a part of the X-Men team assembled to investigate a mutant baby detected in Alaska. When they got there, they were too late and found all of the children there have been killed. They hunted down <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a> because they suspect that they kidnapped the mutant baby. When Wolverine find out through <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> that the baby is in the possession of another X-Man, <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a>, Cyclops assembled a new team of the X-force, with Wolverine as team leader, and their objective is to retrieve the mutant baby from Cable, by any means necessary. When Cable was battling the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/purifiers/65-14915/\">Purifiers</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/reavers/65-9726/\">Reavers</a>, led by Lady Deathstrike, the X-Force joined the battle, giving Cable the opportunity to commandeer the X-Force's <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/blackbird/18-41920/\">Blackbird</a> to escape. In the last battle against the Marauders, Wolverine lets himself be swallowed by <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/predator-x/29-47143/\">Predator X</a> to tear it from the inside out.</p><h2>Leader of X-Force</h2><p>After Messiah Complex, Cyclops realized that there are some enemies of the X-Men and those who too much of a threat for the endangered mutants everywhere that needs to be dealt with permanently. He reassembles <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> without anyone the X-Men's knowledge, and the first foe he sends them after are Matthew Risman and the Purifiers.</p><h2><b>Powers</b></h2><p>Like all other super-powered mutants, Wolverine was born with a special power, which in his case was an incredible healing ability which would enable him to recover from injuries at surprising speed. It appears to be this ability that made it possible for Wolverine's entire skeleton to be reinforced with adamantium, the Marvel Universe's most nearly indestructible known metal. Wolverine's claws, which he uses as the deadliest of weapons, are made of adamantium, too, and extend from the backs of his hands at his mental command. There is more to that hot temper that Wolverine displays: he has an animalistic, murderous side to his personality that once seemed wholly uncontrollable. Even when Wolverine is in full control of himself, he can be ruthless with his enemies.</p><p>Wolverine is a mutant with the abilities to rapidly heal and regenerate damage inflicted upon his body. His healing factor has increased in strength through the years that the only way to kill Wolverine is to decapitate him and remove his brain from the vicinity of his body. He is immune to most drugs and poisons, and his rate of aging has been slowed down considerably. His healing factor was originally supposed to be just accelerated healing, however, through the years, writers have made his healing much more powerful to the point where he could regenerate lost organs. Since Wolverine has the ability to heal quickly, his stamina is practically limitless. An example of Wolverine's incredible stamina is when he fought Omega Red for 18 straight hours. Wolverine’s healing factor also allows him to push his strength beyond any normal human being’s limit.</p><p>Wolverine possesses amazing agility and reflexes. He possesses animalistic senses which allow him to see further than normal humans; he can also track living beings by scent. His other senses are so strong that even in complete darkness, Wolverine can basically see through it. He is able to hear things that normal humans cannot, and he can also hear sounds across great distances. Wolverine’s physical build is also a part of his mutation in which he has sharp teeth and three retractable bone <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/wolverines-claws/12-46496/\">Wolverine's Claws</a> housed in his fore-arms. His bone claws are strong enough to cut through most types of materials. When he extracts his claws, they pierce through his knuckles, but his healing factor closes the wound right away. During the Weapon X program, Wolverine's skeletal system and claws were coated with adamantium making them virtually unbreakable. The adamantium gives Wolverine the ability to cut through any solid material. The adamantium infused throughout Wolverine's skeleton also protects his brain, as it is laced through his skull. The adamantium also allows Wolverine to lift heavy objects without shattering any bones.</p><p><b>Strength Level</b></p><p>Wolverine possesses the normal human strength of a man of his apparent age, height and build who engages in regular exercise.</p><h2><b>Weaknessess</b></h2><p>It has been revealed on several occasions in the past that Wolverines brain must be mostly intact for him to be able to regenerate, also that he has problems with swimming due to his heavy skeleton. Writers have been powering up his abilities throughout the years. These limitations seems to be largely ignored recently as Wolverine can regrow organs such as a heart. He also still needs to breathe, and can be killed by drowning.</p><p>It had also been shown that Wolverine has a weakness in the form of a sword called the Muramasa Blade (for more information, see <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/muramasa/29-50428/\">Muramasa</a>). It seems that the effectiveness of Wolverine's healing factor is greatly decreased when dealing with wounds from this sword. He once received a relatively minor cut from the sword, and the cut took several days to fully heal.</p><p>The adamantium covering his skeleton causes 'adamantium poisoning' which decreases his rate of healing slightly.</p><p>Wolverine has also had problems with the brotherhood leader <a href=\"/magneto/3005-2281/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-2281\">Magneto</a>. In the 90's Magneto pulled out all of the Adamantium from his body, leaving his body with only bone claws and a bone skeleton. Eventually, he got Adamantium and put it back into his body. Since then Wolverine has been more careful around people with magnetic powers.</p><h2><b>Skills</b></h2><p>Logan (James Howlet or Wolverine) has gone through various training's in his life. From practicing physical combat, to strengthen his body, or to spiritual training, which would help him control his anger and prove to be a valuable asset in combat. Formerly being a samurai, government agent, X-Man, and part of the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/avengers/3806/\">Avengers</a>. He has exceptional hand-to-hand fighting skills, as well as being adept at using many different types of weapons. Throughout his entire life traveling the world, Wolverine has become a master of every form of martial arts. Wolverine was also a samurai and was a skilled katana user. Wolverine’s hand-to-hand combat is extremely good to the point where he can defeat <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/shang-chi/29-12716/\">Shang-Chi</a> and he is not as good as Captain America due to Wolverine being a brawler, who are both masters at hand-to-hand combat. Wolverine is also skilled in espionage due to his time in the army and being made a weapon.</p><p>In addition to his physical skills, Wolverine is very intelligent. Having had an increased lifespan, he traveled around the world and amassed knowledge of foreign culture. He speaks fluent English, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Cheyenne, and Lakota and knows some French, German, Thai, Vietnamese, Italian, and Portuguese.</p><p>Wolverine has the ability to go into berserker rage in which his mind acts on animal instinct and rage. During this mode he is immune to any psionic attack and attacks relentlessly.</p><p>Wolverine is also capable of using attacks such as the <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/fastball-special/12-41709/\">Fastball Special</a>, a move which was perfected with Colossus. It involves Colossus throwing Wolverine at much greater speeds than he could have attained on his own. It is also beneficial in helping Wolverine reach areas that he couldn't have reached on his own. A slightly different technique is also used with <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, known as the Cannonball Special.</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><p><b>Height:</b> 5'3\" Marvel Universe Earth-616 (Main Universe), Ultimate universe 5'5\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 300 lbs (Without Adamantium skeleton), 750 lbs (with Adamantium skeleton)</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Black</p><h3>COSTUMES</h3><p>Over his 30 year history Wolverine has worn many different costumes here a the most reconcilable costumes of his history.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462314-7220810426-Incre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2462314\" data-ratio=\"1.4475\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:144.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462314-7220810426-Incre.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2462314\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462314-7220810426-Incre.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462314-7220810426-Incre.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462314-7220810426-Incre.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462314-7220810426-Incre.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px\" data-width=\"442\"></noscript></a></figure><p><b>Original costume</b></p><p>Debut: The incredible Hulk #180 [1974]</p><p>Little did Hulk readers know that the pint-size psycho with the claws would become one of the comic book worlds most loved and most popular superhero’s of all time.

The challenge fell to the original creator of the X-men Stan Lee and editor Roy Thomas. Writer Len Wein and artist Dave Cockrum. Wolverine’s costume was redone but not much changed they kept the blue and yellow color scheme but there was some changes, the new costume’s mask no longer looked like an animal’s face it had two big black points, it was said this new mask was to much like the Batman mask. Wolverine would wear this costume for over 20 years.</p><p> </p><p> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2462343\" data-ratio=\"1.3883333333333\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:138.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2462343\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg 600w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg 460w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg\" srcset=\"https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg 600w, https://giantbomb1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_small/7/72471/2462343-3737237566-Wolve.jpg 460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" data-width=\"460\"></noscript></a></figure><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>RED AND BROWN</strong></p><p>Debut: Uncanny X-men #139 [1980]</p><p>John Byrne gave Wolverine a new grittier look this look was to show us a more muted mutant, this costume became a fan favorite and Wolverine would wear the suit for over two decades.
